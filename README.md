# Some context

This [link](https://www.mmobomb.com/api?ref=devresourc.es) show the documentation to the API that was used during this CA.

I wanted to include the full list for games that the API have to offer and then include a way for the user to filter the list or search in the list. I did not manage to do this, but i left the code i wanted to use to create the search, i just did not find a way to include it in the code. So I think i have to sit down and plan my work more when i create JS. Because if i make the script work, and then want to include something new i have some issues. So instead i should organize the work more so i can include all function in the right order and not try to add inn scripts after.

## Loader svg

The loader i have used is the same i used in MA3, and I'm not the creator of the svg.
The loading SVG is not my work.

[I found the loading svg here](https://freefrontend.com/css-loaders/)

[The code for the Svg is from this codepen](https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/yjoPMJ?editors=0100)
